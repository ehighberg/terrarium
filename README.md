## Planning

> You've got a little over a week to reach your Minimum Viable Product. Use these sections to plan out your approach.

<br>

### Timeframes

> Use this section to estimate the time necessary to build out the various sections of your project. You may include an additional priority matrix, if you desire.

| Task                | Priority | Estimated Time | Actual Time |
| ------------------- | :------: | :------------: | :---------: |
| Add Contact Form    |    L     |     3 hrs      |    3 hrs    |
| Create CRUD Actions |    H     |     3 hrs      |     TBD     |
| TOTAL               |          |     6 hrs      |     TBD     |

> _Why is this necessary? Time frames are key to the development cycle. You have limited time to code your app, and your estimates can then be used to evalute possibilities of your MVP and post-MVP based on time needed. It's best you assume an additional hour for each component, as well as a few hours added to the total time, to play it safe._

<br>

### Schedule

> Use this section to look at your project week and plan out when and what you want to do.
